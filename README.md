Implementation of a card game in Godot 

Sprites and game concept are not open source - they are property of Looney Labs. Card game code in Godot Script is however. I am not likley going to continue working on this project - unless others are interested and want to calaborate. My main purpose in opening this repo is as an example of how to implement a card game in Godot. 

Sorry for the lack of comments - I will try to at least come back to it once more and add comments on my next commit.
